# 🚀 FTTH Downstream Address Selector

Automate downstream address selection in FTTH design — save time, improve accuracy.

# 📌 Overview

In FTTH (Fiber To The Home) network design, it's often necessary to verify connection points — for example, calculating how many users or MSTs (Multiport Service Terminals) are connected from a specific point on the cable to its end.

Manually selecting addresses multiple times with the Selection Feature tool can be time-consuming and error-prone.

# ⚡ What This Tool Does

This tool automates the selection of downstream addresses starting from a clicked point on the network. It helps you:

⏱ Save time — avoid repeated manual selections

🎯 Improve accuracy — quickly verify user and MST counts

🛠 Streamline workflows — make FTTH design more efficient

With this tool, FTTH designers can focus on network planning rather than repetitive selection tasks.
